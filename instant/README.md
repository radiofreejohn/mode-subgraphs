# Instant Subgraphs

[Goldsky's Instant Subgraphs](https://docs.goldsky.com/reference/config-file/instant-subgraph)

Simple JSON config file to index a contract with an ABI.

Here we grab the ABI from [Mode's block explorer](https://modescan.io/token/0xcDd475325D6F564d27247D1DddBb0DAc6fA0a5CF/contract/code)

All ERC-20 contracts should use a common ABI. Same is true for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 (though they differ from each other).
